				<p>
					The users of this site is anyone who wants to list their items they would like to complete throughout the day 
					or would like to save things they would complete later. The users of this page could be students, educators, 
					or anyone with a busy schedule. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Through this application, I would like my users to have the ability to make remembering and organziing things they need
					to complete throughout the day or even days and weeks easier. They can easily see all their tasks and easily remove them once they are done.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem I am trying to solve is that some people forget important taks they need to do and some people just have a hard time 
					organzing those taks and get overwhelmed if they did those tasks or not. I want this appliaction to be able to ease those 
					difficulties for them. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of the things I would like the users of this site to do is tell people they know that might benefit from this site. 
					Also, I would like users to provide feedback on developments and changes that can be made on this site. Another thing I would 
					users to do is think of other ways they might be able to use this site. Even though this is a to do list, users can use the site 
					for other things. An example could be a user that needs to call people, they can use this site to add people they need to call and 
					delete once they are done.
