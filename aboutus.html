				<p> Hi, my name is Haaris, the founder of this site and also a senior at Georgia State University
					studying computer science. I am very passionate about software engineering and tech and hope to 
					break into the field after graduation. One of the reasons I love this field is that it constantly 
					keeps you learning and curious about new technologies and how we can use them to make the world a 
					better place. I am also big a soccer fan and gamer. 
				</p>
				<p> This project is a To-Do list application that allows users to add things/tasks they would like to 
					complete throughout the day. It also has the option to save tasks so they can complete them later. This 
					functionality requires the user to register. Users can delete the task once they have completed it.
					The reason I chose to do this project was becuase I thought it would be helpful and would allow myself, and other users to
					organize their daily life.
				</p>
				<p> The technology I used for this site was JavaScript to handle functionality such as adding and deleting items, HTML/CSS 
					for user interface, MySQL to store user info and items, and PHP handle connection with database. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This Web Programming class has given me a great deal of knowledge of web programming languages and how they work together. 
					It has also allowed me to gain experience with these languages which has made me a more confident and better engineer. Some of things 
					I have learned are how to style and setup a user interfaces, how to setup databases and how to use them in your code, and how to run your 
					site in the cloud.
